You will also explore the capability types, evolutionary characteristics and get even more useful information.</description></item><item><title>Landscape and trends assessment</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/landscape-and-trends-assessment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/landscape-and-trends-assessment/</guid><description>About this talk: A map of a competitive business Landscape (a Wardley map) is visual and context-specific where the anchor is the User being served and their corresponding needs. The map contains a value chain — capabilities necessary to fulfill the needs, arranged according to their dependency relationships.
By attending this sessions, you will learn more details on the landscape and corresponding trends assessment, the position of the capabilities on the Wardley map and more information related to the topic.</description></item><item><title>Mapping culture</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/mapping-culture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/mapping-culture/</guid><description>About this talk: Wardley Mapping is a straight-forward process, and most difficulties boil down to concerns about making “mistakes” or doing the “wrong” thing. It is much more valuable to discard these concerns up-front, embrace the messiness of the process, and learn by boldly doing. The process of mapping is also the process of constructing a model of reality. An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success.</description></item><item><title>Moving from Graphs to Maps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/moving-from-graphs-to-maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/moving-from-graphs-to-maps/</guid><description>About this talk: Each component in a Wardley map is classified by the value it has to the customer or user and by the maturity of that component, ranging from custom-made to commodity. Components are drawn as nodes on a graph with value on the y-axis and commodity on the x-axis. A custom-made component with no direct value to the user would sit at the bottom-left of such a graph while a commodity component with high direct value to the user would sit at the top-right of such a graph.</description></item><item><title>PSD &amp; Squads &amp; Tribes &amp; Team Topologies</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/team-topologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/team-topologies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Real World Wardley Maps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/real-world-wardley-maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/real-world-wardley-maps/</guid><description>About this talk: Wardley Mapping is a value-chain mapping technique that has taken the strategy world by storm in recent years. First developed by Simon Wardley to navigate the emerging cloud computing industry, it&amp;rsquo;s now exploded into dozens of different industries and applications. It is used both in the public and private sectors to great effect. This session will provide you with real world examples of companies providing services in digital security that have applied Wardley maps and the results that they have reached.</description></item><item><title>Risk Mapping - Applying Risk overlay with maps and security decision making</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/risk-overlay-with-maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/risk-overlay-with-maps/</guid><description>About this talk: The more data penetrates into various industries, the more security threats and risks appear and it becomes really essential to deal with those risks and make the most optimal decisions.
In this session we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how Wardley maps can be applied to improve the decision making process.</description></item><item><title>Security implications of the isolation and terrorism</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/security-implications-isolation-and-terrorism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/security-implications-isolation-and-terrorism/</guid><description>About this talk: We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, prevent or spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content, successfully manage incidents.</description></item><item><title>Simon Wardley Keynote</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/keynote/wardley-maps-keynote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/keynote/wardley-maps-keynote/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Strategy Development - applying the concepts</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/strategy-development-applying-the-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/strategy-development-applying-the-concepts/</guid><description>About this talk: One of the more curious aspects of Wardley Mapping is the Doctrine — what we choose to believe are universally-applicable principles. The doctrine is essentially values-based ideas like putting users first and being open to challenge. While Simon’s doctrine is a great place to start, it’s also true that you can begin to discover and choose principles of your own.
Attend this session, learn more about the doctrine and develop your own strategy for reaching your own goals.</description></item><item><title>Threat Mapping (Social practice theory and applying maturity mapping)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/threat-mapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/threat-mapping/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wardley Mapping - content from last Summit</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/content/sessions-last-summit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/content/sessions-last-summit/</guid><description>Sessions focusing on the use of Wardley Maps in Security.

It&amp;rsquo;s is a map of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed to serve the customer or the user. Wardley maps are named after Simon Wardley who created them in 2005. By attending this session, you will have an exceptional chance to get some basic knowledge on Wardley mapping, learn about its main pillars, get ideas for its practical usage and explore your most important questions directly with Simon Wardley and other participants.</description></item></channel></rss>
