What is the tolerance and capacity levels of vulnerabilities or issues to go live with for each team? How long can they be tolerated, time limits.. (&amp;hellip;)
Common language, terminology, with business. (&amp;hellip;)
Asset depreciation for security risk. (&amp;hellip;)
Value return on spend on specific controls, how to measure. Use maps? (&amp;hellip;)
Where do you spend your money, on fixing issues which are fast to fix or slow?</description></item><item><title>Security Standards of today</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/security-standards-of-today/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/security-standards-of-today/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Third Party Assurance</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/third-party-assurance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/third-party-assurance/</guid><description>Why Every company has their own third party due diligence method. Mostly a mix of questionnaires, open source investigations, sometimes onsite assessments. This is not efficient in today&amp;rsquo;s world as poor vendors are forced to spend 100s of hours each year filling in questionniares with same or similar questions over and over again. It’s not efficient for every outfit to ask their own Qs that are very similar. But CISOs are reluctant to trust BitSight/RiskLedger/other 3rd party compliance snapshots.</description></item><item><title>Threat Personas and Application Vulnerability Scoring Model</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/user-sessions/threat-personas-and-application-vulnerability-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso-and-risk-management/user-sessions/threat-personas-and-application-vulnerability-management/</guid><description>This model will help prioritise vulnerabilities discovered in your applications. Generating some threat personas Collaborative discussion around how to improve the model
After the session, the organisers will decide on any changes needed on the model and create a survey for attendees to get everyone&amp;rsquo;s opinions on relative weightings in the model. Once that&amp;rsquo;s collected they plan to write up and publish the model in github under an open license. Pretty cool, heh?</description></item><item><title>Who is the CISO?
