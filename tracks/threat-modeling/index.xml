The aim is to maximise the output number of potential threats and attack vectors by brainstorming abuser stories:
who are the threat actors what are the key assets what are the threats what are the attack vectors / abuser stories potential mitigations and privacy-by-design approaches</description></item><item><title>Lightning Demo - Threatmodel tool demos</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/lightning-demo-threat-model-tool-demos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/lightning-demo-threat-model-tool-demos/</guid><description>Why When choosing a threat model tool, you first need to know what the tool can and cannot do. In order to facilitate this we are organising a number of demonstrations of tools, each 30 minutes long.
What Tool 1: Threat dragon. OWASP Threat Dragon is a tool used to create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their mitigations.
TD is both an online threat modelling web application and a desktop application.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Threat Modeling with LINDDUN</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/privacy-tm-linddun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/privacy-tm-linddun/</guid><description>Why What Things to consider:

We need to learn what researchers are creating and the researching need feedback on what they should be looking for.
What Kim will go into LINDDUN GO (https://www.linddun.org/go) as a way to look into privacy related threats. She will also discuss how to use LINDDUN GO and will be asking for feedback from the community. Koen will present his paper on DFD and a paper on maturity of threat modeling.</description></item><item><title>Threat modeling Zoom and Remote Working Practices</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-zoom-and-remote-working-practices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-zoom-and-remote-working-practices/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threatmodel tool demos - Wednesday</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/izar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/izar/</guid><description>Why When choosing a threat model tool, you first need to know what the tool can and cannot do.
