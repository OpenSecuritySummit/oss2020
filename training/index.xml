In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. In this talk, I will present an overview of enterprise cyber risk and supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.</description></item><item><title>Team Topologies &amp; Compliance as code</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-cloud-detonation-chambers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-cloud-detonation-chambers/</guid><description>In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll do threat modelling for using a cloud funtion as a detonation chamber. A detonation chamber as defined by NIST, is an ideal capability for providing vulnerability shielding. They allow for a thorough analysis of objects entering an environment to determine if they are malicious or contain exploit code targeting a known vulnerability or an unknown/zero-day vulnerability.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - ICAP</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-icap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-icap/</guid><description>In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into the Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP). The protocol is used to extend proxy servers and investigation is ongoing on how to integrate CDR technology with Proxy companies like F5 through ICAP to allow safe transfer of documents accross domains. We&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a threat model to better undertand potential vulnerabilities.
