Once attending this session, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to create some specific test cases that will be used to validate the requirements of each standard.
In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how to create specific test cases that be used to validate the requirements of each standard.</description></item><item><title>How to measure and visualise ISG standards</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-measure-visualise-standards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-measure-visualise-standards/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: Inspection and Sanitisation Guidance standards allow us to analyze elements and objects contained within the file structures, reveal the data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. They show how identified elements can be a cause for concern for hiding sensitive data to ensure that files are safer for users to open and conform to the specification. Whilst getting acquainted to ISG standards in details in one of our sessions, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to measure and visualise these standards.</description></item><item><title>NCSC - Safe File Import Pattern</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/ncsc-safe-file-import/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/ncsc-safe-file-import/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have published a pattern on how to safely import data into an organization. This can be found at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pattern-safely-importing-data
The pattern fundamentally recommends a Transform and Verify approach to imports as shown below:
This has some significant differences to import processes typically in use in commercial environments.
The objective of this session is to raise the awareness of this pattern, highlight the differences in the pattern and the pros/cons of them, and to explore the practicalities of using this patter in commercial environments.</description></item><item><title>Office Documents ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: Once learning about the potential areas of concern that exist within office documents and exploring ISGs for them, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to discover the testing strategies that will be oriented on validation of the requirements of the ISGs. This session will be dedicated to automation of ISG testing for Office documents.

In this session we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore ISGs for PDF files which will include inspection and analysis on various elements and objects that are contained within the PDF file structure and how they can be a cause for concern for either hiding sensitive data or attempts to exploit a system.</description></item><item><title>Secure patterns for CDR integration with Web Proxys and Email Providers</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/secure-patterns-for-crd-integration-with-saas-proxys-and-email-providers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/secure-patterns-for-crd-integration-with-saas-proxys-and-email-providers/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure patterns for using CDR in Serverless Environments</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/secure-patterns-for-using-cdr-in-serverless-environments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/secure-patterns-for-using-cdr-in-serverless-environments/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure patterns for using CDR in Serverless Environments</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/isg/secure-patterns-for-using-cdr-in-serverless-environments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/isg/secure-patterns-for-using-cdr-in-serverless-environments/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Securely Handling Fonts in PDFs - Part 1</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Securely Handling Fonts in PDFs - Part 2</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Securely Handling Fonts in PDFs - Part 3</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-3/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Securely Handling Fonts in PDFs - Part 4</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/cdr/securely-handling-fonts-in-pdfs-part-4/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers - Part 1</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</guid><description>Training Session Video</description></item><item><title>What are ISGs and how to convert ISGs into checklists?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</guid><description>About this talk: We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content.</description></item><item><title>What security exploits are prevented by implementing ISGs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: Cyber attackers want access to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive information or intellectual property for strategic advantage, or more commonly, for monetary gain. They commonly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user&amp;rsquo;s computer system and network by using malware delivered via email or web servers.
This session will be dedicated to a discussion of the security exploits that can be prevented by applying ISGs.</description></item></channel></rss>
