Petra and Dinis presented various methods of threat mapping and it was discussed with participants and Simon Wardley. 

# First Map
- Petra's First Map: Petra suggested switching ML algorithms more to the left. Simon suggested moving standardised pharmaceutical processes to right as more industrialised.
# Second Map 
- COVID-19 as threat actor. The anchor is the virus. It needs bad hygiene, individuals at risk, healthy travelling individuals and crowded places. The evolution of it in the context of Summer 2020 and how to represent the context. 
# Third Map 
- Various attacks and the targets represented on a map. Pros and cons discussed. It is visual, it sparks a conversation but some details are not represented. 
# Fourth Map
- Risk strategy / Information Security Framework map in Glaswall, various components discussed. Penetration testing as example can be industrialised but also custom built and specific to a scope. 
# Fifth Map
- COVID Paths Threat Modelling Map: discussions on value and position on the map of individual components, discussions on contact tracing and the threat model of the app.
# Sixt Map 
 - Mapping Security Domain Knowledge: mapping the current state of the industry. Defining the current landscape where DevSecOps was only emerging - now it has shifted to right and is almost a commodity. 
 # Seventh Map
 - Mapping Security Champions Creation: Maps as a dimension of commincation - to create a strategy or present a formed one. Flow representing metadata of nodes.
 # Eighth Map
 - Threat Modelling Maturity: from developers to security champions. 
 # Ninth Map:
 - Mapping Cyber Attacks: Attackers as users and what do they need within organisations. Mitigations and controls mapped. 
 # Tenth Map:
 - Mapping Security Incidents: Security incident response team detecting AWS key compromise. 
 # Eleventh Map:
 - SOC Team: Map to show where to invest?
 # Twelveth Map:
 - PCI Audit: before and after, using Jira to prepare for auditing. 
 
 Wardley Maps could be used instead of MindMaps.
 Focus on the value chain.
 

## WHY

To create threat modelling strategies with Wardley Maps

## What

Threat Mapping

## Outcomes

Discuss various Wardley Maps for mapping threats and can maps be used to represent threat models.
