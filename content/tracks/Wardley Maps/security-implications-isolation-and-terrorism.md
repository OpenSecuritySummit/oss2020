description  : "We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.  

While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, prevent or spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content, successfully manage incidents. 

How can Wardley maps help struggling these problems? You will get answers to this and many other questions directly from Simon Wardley by attending this session."
