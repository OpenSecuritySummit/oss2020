description  : "One of the more curious aspects of Wardley Mapping is the Doctrine — what we *choose* to believe are universally-applicable principles. The doctrine is essentially values-based ideas like putting users first and being open to challenge.  While Simon’s doctrine is a great place to start, it’s also true that you can begin to discover and choose principles of your own. 

Attend this session, learn more about the doctrine and develop your own strategy for reaching your own goals."
