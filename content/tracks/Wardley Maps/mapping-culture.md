description  : "Wardley Mapping is a straight-forward process, and most difficulties boil down to concerns about making “mistakes” or doing the “wrong” thing. It is much more valuable to discard these concerns up-front, embrace the messiness of the process, and learn by boldly doing.

The process of mapping is also the process of constructing a model of reality. An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success.

Like Simon Wardley says, "Don’t worry if some of the terms are confusing… just use what you can. Like Chess, mapping is a craft and you will get better with practice."

You will have a unique chance to learn more about the mapping culture, get a lot of valuable information and have an interesting discussion with other participants and directly with Simon Wardley."
